- 100g wholewheat couscous, rinsed and drained
- 3 tbsp raisins
- bunch parsley, roughly chopped
- 25g pine nuts
- 100g feta, crumbled
- pinch of cinnamon
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 290g jar grilled whole peppers, drained and rinsed

## Step 1
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the couscous and raisins in a bowl with a pinch of seasoning and just cover with boiling water. Leave to stand for 5 mins.

## Step 2
Fluff the couscous with a fork and stir through the parsley, pine nuts, half the feta, the cinnamon and 2 tbsp of the oil. Mix and season to taste.

## Step 3
Generously stuff the peppers with the couscous mix (any leftover stuffing can be served next to the peppers), then lay them in a small roasting tin and scatter over the remaining feta. Drizzle with the remaining oil and bake in the oven for 15 mins until hot and the feta has turned golden.

- 1 pack instant ramen noodles
- 600ml chicken stock
- ½ cooked chicken breast  sliced
- 4 tbsp sweetcorn, peas or chopped beans
- 1 egg
- sesame oil, to serve (optional)

## Step 1
Put the noodles in a pan (don’t add the flavour sachet). Pour over the stock, bring to the boil, then simmer until cooked (follow pack instructions for cooking time).

## Step 2
Lift the noodles out of the pan and transfer to two bowls. Bring the stock in the pan back to a simmer, then add the chicken and cook until heated through. Scoop the chicken out with a slotted spoon, then transfer to the bowls. Warm the sweetcorn or cook the peas or beans in the stock, bringing back to the boil if you need to, then transfer to the bowl.

## Step 3
Meanwhile, cook the egg in a pan of boiling water for 6 mins. Remove carefully and cool under the cold tap, then peel and halve. Add an egg half to each bowl, then bring the stock back to a simmer and pour it over the noodles. Add a few drops of sesame oil, if you like.

- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small red onion , sliced
- 1 large roasted pepper from a jar, thickly sliced, or a handful of ready-roasted sliced peppers
- 200g quinoa

- small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
- zest and juice 1 lemon
- large pinch sugar

### Step 1
Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a medium saucepan. Cook the onion and pepper for a few mins, then add the quinoa and cook for a further 3 mins. Add the stock, cover and turn the heat down to a simmer. Cook for 15 mins or until soft, then stir through half the parsley. Heat the grill.
